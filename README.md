### Hi there, I'm Amanda Fonseca ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a capstone project to button up my journey with Codeup.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in website design, graphic design, photography, and videography.

ğŸ“• Skills: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me become a better software developer.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on strengthing my skills in front-end and back-end development through Udemy courses.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my journey from the zoo world to the tech industry.

ğŸ“« You can reach me through email at amanda.m.fonseca03@gmail.com.

âš¡ Fun fact: when I have spare time, I love to drag race my 2010 Mustang GT named Black Widow.
